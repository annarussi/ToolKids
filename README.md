**KIDSPEAK**
www.kidspeak.me

During the final two weeks of the nine-week Le Wagon Bootcamp, our group embarked on an ambitious project to develop a laguage-learning mobile app aimed at helping immigrant children learn the local language through a variety of games.

The core objective of KidSpeak was to make language learning fun and accessible. The idea is to engage young learners with
interactive games, visual aids, and audio pronunciation guides. By making the learning process interactive and entertaining, we aimed to foster a positive attitude towards language acquisition and encourage regular practice.

We used a diverse range of programming languages and technologies. Our backend was built using Ruby on Rails, a robust and reliable framework known for its simplicity and efficiency. On the frontend, we employed JavaScript, to enable interactivity and dynamic content. To enhance the user experience, we utilized Stimulus, a JavaScript framework that facilitated the seamless integration of interactive elements and improved performance across the app. And the visual design of KidSpeak was crafted using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Due to time constraints (having only two weeks to think, build and deploy it), KidSpeak is not yet a fully polished product. It is only a demo meant to be presented as a final project of a bootcamp and to show its potential for further development, which is currently being planned. **Thus, for the time being, the app can be better seen in a mobile format (particularly Iphone 12 Pro, using Chrome's inspect tool)**.
